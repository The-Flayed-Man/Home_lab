As a System Specialist at MIAX Exchange Group, I manage and maintain the Linux-based infrastructure of a leading options exchange in the US. With over 2 1/2 years of professional experience in this role, I bring expertise in system operations and Red Hat Linux administration, along with hands-on experience in automation, monitoring, and optimization. Overall, I have 8 years of Linux experience, with 5 years in a professional capacity, and 3 years of DevOps experience.

At MIAX, I am helping to build out a new exchange and constantly expanding my technical skills in trading systems to support both myself and newer team members. I created a Python script to help the team learn about key applications and acronyms, and I have been tasked with transforming my personal wiki into a comprehensive resource for new hires.

Previously, I worked as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer and Red Hat System Admin at Truist Bank, focusing on IT systems integration and automation in a highly regulated financial environment. I ensured that critical security and uptime requirements were met, maintaining compliance and reliability in all operations. I successfully led the automation of system provisioning processes, adding security benchmarks to ensure servers passed federal audits, which accelerated the server turnover process for the entire team by eliminating the need for manual remediation. I am skilled in managing complex IT environments, using tools such as Ansible, Splunk, Grafana, and Prometheus.

I am currently expanding my skills by learning Ansible, Git, Kubernetes, Docker, Python scripting, and other DevOps methodologies to stay at the forefront of industry trends. I thrive in collaborative teams, bringing effective communication and technical expertise to deliver reliable, secure solutions.

My goal is to continue learning, growing, and contributing to MIAX's innovation and excellence. I am committed to maintaining secure, compliant infrastructure in highly regulated industries.
